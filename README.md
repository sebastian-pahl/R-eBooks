# Strava-project
Repository for the data files, R code and output of my Strava project.I am using the raw gpx data files to try and replicate some stats given by my favourite app Strava.
The purpose of this is only to learn and become better at using R as a programming language.

- First the gpx is read into R and a data frame is created using the code in Strava_data_table.R
- To easily see some sample output, just open the pdf: Strava_plots.pdf
- To open the html file or the .Rmd file, clone the Strava-projects repository to your local hardrive.
- The best would be to open the .Rmd file in R Studio
