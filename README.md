# Strava-project
Repository for the R code and data I am using to build a package using Strava gpx files as input.
The purpose of this is only to learn and become better at using R as a programming language.

To see the code, look at Strava_data_table.R and Strava_plotting.R in the R code folder.
To see some sample output, look in the Sample output folder.
